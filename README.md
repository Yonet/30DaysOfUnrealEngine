## Overview

30 days of [Unreal Engine Development for HoloLens 2](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/mixed-reality/unreal-development-overview?WT.mc_id=spatial-6125-ayyonet) is our journey ([Ayşegül](https://github.com/Yonet) and [Em](https://github.com/lazerwalker), to learn Unreal development for Mixed Reality. We are part of [Azure Cloud Advocacy Team](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/mixed-reality/community#azure-cloud-advocate-spatial-computing-team?WT.mc_id=spatial-6125-ayyonet) and experienced developers who are learning Unreal Development together. 

First we start our journey from the [HoloLens Chess App Tutorial](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/mixed-reality/unreal-uxt-ch1?WT.mc_id=spatial-6125-ayyonet) and we add new features to make it a full featured game with AI, real time multi players streamed state and AI. Follow along by downloading or forking the repo branch for the day. Some of the features we will build are:


* When you finish moving a piece, snap it to the nearest grid position on the board. If your move is not valid chess, snap the piece back to its previous position.
* Add in Azure [Cognitive Services](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cognitive-services/?WT.mc_id=aiml-8438-ayyonet) [voice support](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cognitive-services/what-are-cognitive-services?WT.mc_id=aiml-8438-ayyonet#language-apis) for interactions (e.g. “Pawn to D4”)
* Send board data updates between the two users sessions — a good chance to try out [PlayFab](https://docs.microsoft.com/gaming/playfab/?WT.mc_id=aiml-8438-ayyonet#pivot=documentation&panel=authentication)?)
* Detect if a player has won, or if stalemate has happened.
* Add support for smartphone AR and translating hand interactions to 2D drag interactions.
* Add in [Azure Spatial Anchors(ASA)](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/spatial-anchors/?WT.mc_id=spatial-6125-ayyonet) to let players and viewers share a board in the same physical location. 

We would like to build more games after the Chess App is done. Let us know what you are interested in learning by opening an issue on this repo or reaching out to us on twitter [@AysSomething](https://twitter.com/AysSomething) or [@LazerWalker](https://twitter.com/lazerwalker).
